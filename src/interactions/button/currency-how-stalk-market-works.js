            > - Every Sunday, you'll have the option to buy some carrots.
            >  - These will have a fixed buy price.
            > - After buying carrots, you can sell them on any day except Sunday. The price of carrots will change every 12 hours (00:00 and 12:00, GMTÂ±0000).
            > - The prices of the carrots will follow a pattern, similarly to the ${Discord.hyperlink(`stalk market in the Animal Crossing series`, `https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Stalk_Market`)}.
